Credit Card Transaction Report using PowerBI
To create a comprehensive credit card dashboard in Power BI that delivers real-time insights into key
performance metrics and trends, start by defining your objectives and the metrics you want to track. 
Common metrics for a credit card transaction report include total spend (the overall amount spent using 
credit cards), transaction volume (the number of transactions processed), average transaction value 
(the average amount spent per transaction), and top merchants (merchants with the highest transaction volumes).
